------------
cvalid is a worksheet data validity checker with a graphical user interface. Duplicates found in the specified column will be printed below the input boxes. By default, column 6 will be examined. 3 rows at the beginning at each worksheet will be skipped. Zero worksheets at the beginning of each workbook will be skipped. Workbooks strung together will be examined across one another for duplicates.
